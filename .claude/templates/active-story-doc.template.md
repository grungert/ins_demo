## Story Quality Checklist

### Per-Story Validation
- [ ] Title follows format: `<COMPONENT> | <SCOPE> | <Short description>`
- [ ] Narrative uses: "As a... I want... so that..."
- [ ] Description explains WHAT and WHY
- [ ] Acceptance criteria use GIVEN/WHEN/THEN
- [ ] Language is non-technical (no hooks, props, components)
- [ ] Story sized at 1-1.5 developer days or less
- [ ] Storybook documentation integrated (not separate story)
- [ ] No separate testing story (testing integrated)
- [ ] All visual elements from design listed in ACs
- [ ] ACs are collectively exhaustive
- [ ] Time estimate included at bottom

### Overall Validation
- [ ] All functional requirements covered
- [ ] All non-functional requirements covered
- [ ] No acceptance criteria overlap between stories
- [ ] Story sequence logical (infrastructure → implementation → integration)
- [ ] Total effort reasonable for component complexity
