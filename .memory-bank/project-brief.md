# [PROJECT_NAME] - Documentation Project

## Project Overview
**Purpose**: [Brief description of what documentation is being generated - e.g., "Generate comprehensive technical documentation and user stories for the [Project Name], a [type of application] for [target users]"]

**Target Audience**: [Who will read this documentation - e.g., "Development team, QA engineers, product managers, stakeholders"]

**Project Type**: Documentation Repository (Technical Specifications + User Stories)

## Key Objectives
- [Objective 1 - e.g., "Generate exhaustive technical specifications for all components"]
- [Objective 2 - e.g., "Create implementable user stories with detailed acceptance criteria"]
- [Objective 3 - e.g., "Establish reusable component patterns for accelerated documentation"]
- [Objective 4 - e.g., "Build knowledge base of design decisions and best practices"]
- [Objective 5 - e.g., "Enable seamless handoff between design, documentation, and development"]

## Technology Stack
**Primary Framework**: [e.g., "React 18+ with TypeScript", "Vue 3", "Angular 17"]
**UI Library**: [e.g., "Material UI", "Reshaped UI", "Chakra UI", "Custom design system"]
**State Management**: [e.g., "Zustand", "Redux Toolkit", "Pinia", "Context API"]
**Data Fetching**: [e.g., "React Query (TanStack Query)", "SWR", "Apollo Client"]
**Routing**: [e.g., "React Router v6", "Vue Router", "Angular Router"]
**Build Tools**: [e.g., "Vite", "Webpack", "Turbopack"]
**Testing**: [e.g., "Jest + React Testing Library", "Vitest + Testing Library"]
**Design Tool**: [e.g., "Figma", "Sketch", "Adobe XD"] - Single source of truth for visual design

## Component Architecture
**Atomic Design Methodology**:
- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs, labels, icons)
- **Molecules**: Composite components (search bars, cards, form groups)
- **Organisms**: Complex features (headers, sidebars, data grids, navigation)
- **Widgets**: Standalone mini-applications (filter panels, column managers, wizards)

*Note: Adapt this classification system to your project's architecture if needed*

## Constraints & Requirements

**Platform**:
- [Platform target - e.g., "Desktop-first approach (no mobile device support)", "Mobile-first responsive design", "Universal responsive design"]
- [Responsive strategy - e.g., "Responsive for desktop window sizing (min ~768px width)", "Mobile breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px"]
- [Accessibility - e.g., "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance", "WCAG 2.1 AAA for critical flows"]

**Technical**:
- [Design system - e.g., "Design system adherence (Material Design theming)", "Custom design system"]
- [Tokenization - e.g., "Semantic design token usage (no hardcoded values)"]
- [Browser support - e.g., "Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)", "IE11 compatibility"]
- [Performance - e.g., "Core Web Vitals targets", "Load time < 2s on 3G"]

**Timeline**:
- [Documentation approach - e.g., "Iterative documentation generation per component"]
- [Priorities - e.g., "Priority: Core navigation and data visualization components first"]
- [Process - e.g., "Continuous improvement of documentation patterns"]

**Team**: [Team structure - e.g., "Documentation team + Development team coordination", "Cross-functional product team"]

**Scalability**: [User load expectations - e.g., "Consumer app for 10K+ concurrent users", "Internal admin tool for moderate load"]

## Business Context
[Optional section - Add relevant business context]:
- **Domain**: [e.g., "Healthcare", "E-commerce", "Finance", "Enterprise SaaS"]
- **User Base**: [e.g., "Internal employees", "B2B customers", "General consumers"]
- **Key Workflows**: [List primary user workflows if relevant]
- **Compliance**: [e.g., "HIPAA compliant", "GDPR compliant", "SOC 2"]

## Documentation Standards
[Project-specific documentation requirements]:
- **Story Sizing**: [e.g., "1-1.5 developer days per story maximum"]
- **AC Format**: GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format, non-technical language
- **Testing**: [e.g., "Storybook documentation integrated into relevant stories"]
- **Review Process**: [e.g., "Tech doc review by tech lead, story review by PM"]

## Notes
[Any additional context or special considerations for documentation generation]
